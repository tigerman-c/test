In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>\n               \n        <h4>Third Party Services on Our Services</h4>\n        <p>We may (whether in advertisements or otherwise within our services) provide you with links that allow you to access third party services or websites.</p>\n        <p>These third party services may be hosted by the relevant third party or us. Your use of any such third party services (whether social media services or otherwise), including any Personal Information you provide to such third parties, are subject to the relevant third party’s own terms of services and privacy policies and not the User Agreement  or this Privacy Policy, so please review their terms carefully.</p>\n        <p>This Privacy Policy only applies to any Information collected by us, does not apply to any services offered by or information practices of any third parties, and we bear no liability for any third party use of any Information provided by you to them.</p>\n       \n        <h4>The Security of Your Personal Information</h4>\n        <p>We are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your personal information no matter where it is stored. Our group companies have information security and access policies that limit access to our systems and technology. We also protect data through the use of technological protection measures such as encryption. Your personal information will remain subject to our technical and organisational controls and our policies and procedures (including this Privacy Policy).</p>\n        <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

If you require us to destroy your personal information before the end of its life cycle (as set out in the retention policy above), we will destroy your personal information in accordance with local laws).</p>\n       \n        <h4>Your Rights</h4>\n        <p>This section (“Your Rights”) applies to users that are located in the European Economic Area only.

You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party.</p>\n        <p>If you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g., where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).</p>\n         \n        <h4>Correction</h4>\n        <p>You have the right to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate.

We will help you delete your personal information after verifying your identity.</p>\n        <p>You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:</p>\n        <p>• you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold such personal information; or</p>\n        <p>• you believe the personal information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.</p>\n        <p>You can also exercise your right to restrict our processing of your personal information (as described below) whilst we consider your request.</p>\n        <p>We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Game Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.</p>\n       \n        <h4>Restriction of Processing to Storage Only</h4>\n        <p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). As above, where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.</p>\n        <p>You may request we stop processing and just store the personal information we hold about you where:</p>\n        <p>• you believe the personal information is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate;</p>\n        <p>• you wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to retain the personal information but just store it instead; or</p>\n        <p>• you wish to erase the personal information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>\n       \n        <h4>Objection</h4>\n        <p>You have the right to object to our processing of personal information about you. We will consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below by contacting us.</p>\n              \n        <h4>Announcements</h4>\n        <p>We may from time to time send you announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (such as when we temporarily suspend Game access for maintenance, or security, privacy or administrative-related communications). You may not opt-out of these service-related announcements, which are not promotional in nature.</p>\n       \n        <h4>Contact & Complaints</h4>\n        <p>For the purposes of European Data Protection Law, the Data Controller is Hong Kong Chuang Cool Interactive Entertainment Limited.</p>\n        <p>In the event that you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal information, please contact us in the first instance.</p>\n        <p>--Contact Information--</p>\n        <p>Name: Hong Kong Chuang Cool Interactive Entertainment Limited</p>\n        <p>Mail: chuangcool@hotmail.com</p>\n        <p>This is without prejudice to your right to launch a claim with the data protection authority in the country in which you live or work where you think we have infringed data protection laws.</p>\n               \n        <h4>Changes</h4>\n        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting the amended terms in our Game or websites.
